  "body_part_breakdown": {
    "arms_analysis": "Initial sessions highlighted issues with 'Elbow Flare'. However, consistent improvement led to excellent 'Elbow Tuck' and 'Wrist Position' stability, culminating in high-scoring sessions with no primary arm faults, indicating strong and stable arm mechanics.",
    "legs_analysis": "Early on, the 'Hip Sag' fault indicated a lack of lower body tension and stability. Through subsequent training, the ability to maintain a 'Neutral Spine' and 'Consistent Depth' improved dramatically, demonstrating enhanced leg and glute engagement to maintain a rigid, plank-like position, crucial for perfect pushup depth.",
    "core_analysis": "Core stability was a major initial weakness, manifesting as 'Hip Sag' and 'Core Instability' in early sessions. Dedicated remedial work, such as 'Modified Plank' and 'Deadbug', led to significant improvement. The user now consistently exhibits a 'Stable Core' and 'Neutral Spine', which are key strengths in recent high-scoring performances."
